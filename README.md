## The Project Abstract

The project we have chosen is, SIN Greenhouse. The main goal of the project is to impelment a SIN Greenhouse in a industrial network of, for example, a farmer. Display this on two dashboards: one to display the temperature, one to display but also to manipulate the data. To work out this project, the group members were divided into two groups. One group taking care of Raspberry Pi and With Node-Red and mqtt. Then also one with the security app. First we looked to set up the Raspberry Pi, the installation of node red and mqtt. Making a dashboard to display the temperature and display the status of the heater (on/off) and the motor for the window(open/closed). for the security app we will display the same, but we add the feature to manipulate the data of the temperatuur sensor so you menage to change the status of the elements like the heater in the serre.
